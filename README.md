- 👋 Hi, I’m @isabellastrutman
- 👀 I’m interested in mostly game development centered projects. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the language C# and all of it's ins and outs. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a some sort of interactive experience. I've always wanted to work with someone one on one with somthing as in depth as a game.
